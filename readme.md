# Randar
Pronounced with a country twang, Randar is the film creation suite for animated productions at Litty Studios.

# Purpose
Randar is a suite for:

* Creating models from imported meshes, textures, and riggings (excluding animations & keyframes)
* Animating models
* Applying lighting and shadows
* Applying special physics effects
* Sequencing scenes
* Rendering scenes
* Exporting scenes to images and videos

Randar is *not* a suite for:

* Creating static textures
* Creating and texturing models
* Image and video file manipulation

Built with C++11 and OpenGL 3.3 with an embedded chromium interface. Created for Linux with future Windows and Mac OS support.

# Structure
This software is a combination of a few software concepts:

* 3D rendering engine
* Resource creation engine
* Scene sequencing engine
* Interface for controlling engines

# Installation
Yell "RANDAR" at your computer to start compiling. Novices may find it helpful to cross fingers and click heels together three times.

If you run into issues, shake fists angrily at the computer.

# But seriously
Use a Linux machine with a GPU supporting OpenGL 3.3. Tested with Debian, probably works with other distributions.

Install glfw3.

Download, compile, and install [Awesomium 1.7.5|http://www.awesomium.com/].

Execute go.sh.
