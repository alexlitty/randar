# Randar
Pronounced with a country twang, Randar is my personal 3D rendering engine for animated film production.

Built for Linux and OpenGL 3.x with no intention to port. 

# Usage
Randar is compiled into a library, which is then used by individual film projects.

Yell "RANDAR" at your computer to start compiling. Novices may find it helpful to cross fingers and click heels together three times.

If you run into issues, shake fists angrily at the computer.
