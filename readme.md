# Randar: A Legacy Project
This is the foundation for an old C++ & OpenGL 3D film rendering engine idea.

I've moved onto new ambitions within the Rust community. The repository is preserved as a learning experience for others and a showcase of some historical work.

# Installation
You're welcome to give the library a try locally. To install, simply run:

    git clone https://github.com/alexlitty/randar.git
    cd randar
    ./run/install

Randar was created to be Debian-only. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and other Debian derivatives may work out-of-the-box. If dependencies are installed manually, Randar should work on most major Linux distributions.

# License
